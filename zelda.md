Nintendo hasn't had a brand-new Zelda game since 2017, when Breath of the Wild debuted alongside the launch of the Nintendo Switch. The newest Zelda game, Tears of the Kingdom, is right around the corner: It's available May 12. Not only is it the sequel to what's considered one of the greatest games of all time, but it's one of the few times two brand-new Zelda games have arrived in the lifespan of a single Nintendo console. It'll be the Nintendo Switch's most important, must-have game since Animal Crossing.

You may want to avoid spoilers about the new game, but not all that much has been revealed. Zelda games tend to have an aura of mystery. That being said, we've already played an hour or so of the game, which you can read about here.

There are also already several Tears of the Kingdom trailers -- the latest is embedded below -- and a 10-minute gameplay video to comb through. Also, most Zelda games can be enjoyed without playing previous adventures, although Tears of the Kingdom looks so much like a companion to Breath of the Wild that you might want to play that (again) now to get warmed up.
